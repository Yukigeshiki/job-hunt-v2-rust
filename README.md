# job-hunt-v2-rust

[![build](https://github.com/Yukigeshiki/job-hunt-v2-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Yukigeshiki/job-hunt-v2-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A locally run recent job aggregator written in Rust, with a SQLite database, and REPL. Jobs are scraped from job sites and added to the database at start-up and then each time the database is refreshed.

To query jobs you use simplified SQLite syntax. For example, to fetch all senior jobs with the upper bound for remuneration above 100 (if a listing does not include remuneration, the upper and lower bounds will be set at 0), and order them by date posted, you would enter:

```SQL
select jobs where title like "%senior%" and rem_upper > 100 order by date_posted;
```

Table fields for querying include:

```
title text not null
company text not null
date_posted date not null
location text
remuneration text
tags json
apply text not null
site text not null
rem_lower int
rem_upper int
```

To refresh the database enter:

```
refresh
```

And to exit you can use `CTRL-C` or enter:

```
exit
```

There are currently scrapers for a number of Web3 job sites. I will be adding other sites in the future too. Sites included at the moment:
- https://web3.career/
- https://cryptojobslist.com/
- https://jobs.solana.com/jobs
- https://careers.substrate.io/jobs
- https://careers.near.org/jobs

### How to Run Job Hunt

First make sure you have Rust installed. To do this you can follow the instructions found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once installation is complete, clone this repo and from the root directory run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then run:

```bash
./target/release/jobhunt
```

You should see the below info messages followed by a prompt. Happy Job Hunting!

```
Populating local database. This shouldn't take long...
Population completed successfully! Welcome, please begin your job hunt by entering a query.
```

This project is usable but still under Construction! ðŸš§
